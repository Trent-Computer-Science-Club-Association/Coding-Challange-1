This greatly limits our capabilities it proved very challanging some game concepts could not be implemented at all such as sound effects and music, and others such as keeping track of score proved very difficult. The game takes advantage of HTML form elements and sibling selectors to hold state. Essentially our game is a giant &nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">FSM (Finite State Machine)</a>&nbsp; that uses &nbsp;<code>3</code>&nbsp; radio buttons per level a linked &nbsp;<code>correct</code>&nbsp; and &nbsp;<code>incorrect</code>&nbsp; state and a &nbsp;<code>visible state</code>, the code in &nbsp;<code>./templates/styles/game.scss</code>&nbsp; is responsible for manging the games state. This type of programming is very interesting as we are working in a very limited development environment where simple things require getting creative, one such example is moving to the next level which requires massive css selectors and our first implementation caused Chrome to take over a second rendering the webpage everytime an animation was fired. Using css in this way was heavily inspired by &nbsp;<a href="https://keithclark.co.uk/labs/css-fps/">No JavaScript FPS</a>&nbsp; and &nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WSOXT7-5bI">HTMX Pong</a>&nbsp; which are other examples of what is possible in limited development environments.
